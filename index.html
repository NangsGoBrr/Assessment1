<h3>Meet me: Nathan &#128512;</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Steele, I have been interested in IT for a while but I have no previous education or much knowledge behind it. <br> I love playing video games and have always been curious about how they are made and how other technology works. <br>My main question is when seeing with new tech is, how does that work and what “language” is it using to communicate.</p>
      <p>I live in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs with my partner and dog. My dogs’ name is Harper and she is a Staffy x Labrador.<br> I enjoy playing video games with my mates when I can and love a good beer! I used to want to own and run my bar (still do)<br> which is a gaming lounge where people could come and drink and game, play tournaments and watch E-sports events.</p>
      <p>I started thinking about getting into IT as a career path, as I have always been interested in IT and good at it I thought this might be a good place to start. <br> I picked RMIT to do my studies since it offered a bachelor’s in Information technology, and I can do it online while I am working full time.</p>
      <p>I am hoping to get out of this course just a fundamental understanding of IT in general and be able to decide what path I would like to go down. I’ll be able to learn all the basic understanding I need.</p>
      <p>I hope with what I am learning I can find a job within the IT industry. <br>I would love to get a job within game development or coding, I think that would be very fun and interesting to join and grow a career out of.</p>



<h3> Jobs Prospects &#128187; </h3>
      <p>I found this job seek for a <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56123237?type=standout#sol=73641d8dca18cb61811b83c0ecd011951eb51f13">Senior Games Programmer</a> for Wicked Witch Software. This I get to work for an Australian based gaming software company that worked on some of my favourite games like  Age Of Empires 2 which is cool because a lot of the big game developers are international.<br> Working as a senior game programmer will allow me to advance my career in game development and gain more understanding of what it takes to not only make games but to run a businesses</p>
      <p>The position requires at least 5 years of game programming in C++ and C# and communication skills, I don’t have the skill for the programming (C++ and C#) side as I haven’t studied or learnt anything about that kind of programming, but I feel like my previous jobs have given me excellent communication skills.</p>
      <p>My plan for me to succeed in getting this job will have me looking into courses and lower-tier jobs to be able to get my skills as a programmer, while working for another position I can start getting my job experience in the industry and knowledge of programming. </p>
