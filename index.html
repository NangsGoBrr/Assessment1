  <h3 align=center>Meet me: Nathan &#128512;</h3>
        <p align=center>Hello, my name is Nathan Steele, I have been interested in IT for a while but I have no previous education or much knowledge behind it. <br> I love playing video games and have always been curious about how they are made and how other technology works. <br>My main question is when seeing with new tech is, how does that work and what “language” is it using to communicate.</p>
        <p align=center>I live in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs with my partner and dog. My dogs’ name is Harper and she is a Staffy x Labrador.<br> I enjoy playing video games with my mates when I can and love a good beer! I used to want to own and run my bar (still do)<br> which is a gaming lounge where people could come and drink and game, play tournaments and watch E-sports events.</p>
        <p align=center>I started thinking about getting into IT as a career path, as I have always been interested in IT and good at it I thought this might be a good place to start. <br> I picked RMIT to do my studies since it offered a bachelor’s in Information technology, and I can do it online while I am working full time.</p>
        <p align=center>I am hoping to get out of this course just a fundamental understanding of IT in general and be able to decide what path I would like to go down. I’ll be able to learn all the basic understanding I need.</p>
        <p align=center>With what I learn through this course I would love to be able to get a job in game development or something with coding, I think that would be very fun and interesting to join and grow a career out of. The game industry is also very close to my heart as that’s where my passion for computers came about and my hobby has fallen into, my best memories with my friends as a kid and my father are all of us playing games with each other or helping them build computers.</p>
        <p alight=center>So pursuing that dream of working with them more and more is why I think studying the heart and soul of computing is right for me and will take me on an adventure of finding out what IT can do for me, even more than it already has.</p>



  <h3 align=center> Jobs Prospects &#128187; </h3>
        <p align=center>I found this job seek for a <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56123237?type=standout#sol=73641d8dca18cb61811b83c0ecd011951eb51f13">Senior Games Programmer</a> for Wicked Witch Software. This I get to work for an Australian based gaming software company that worked on some of my favourite games like  Age Of Empires 2 which is cool because a lot of the big game developers are international.<br> Working as a senior game programmer will allow me to advance my career in game development and gain more understanding of what it takes to not only make games but to run a businesses</p>
        <p align=center>The position requires at least 5 years of game programming in C++ and C# and communication skills, I don’t have the skill for the programming (C++ and C#) side as I haven’t studied or learnt anything about that kind of programming, but I feel like my previous jobs have given me excellent communication skills.</p>
        <p align=center>My plan for me to succeed in getting this job will have me looking into courses and lower-tier jobs to be able to get my skills as a programmer, while working for another position I can start getting my job experience in the industry and knowledge of programming. </p>
