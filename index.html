<h3>Meet me: Nathan &#128512;</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Nathan Steele, I have been interested in IT for a while but I have no previous education or much knowledge behind it. <br> I love playing video games and have always been curious about how they are made and how other technology works. <br>My main question is when seeing with new tech is, how does that work and what “language” is it using to communicate.</p>
<p>I live in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs with my partner and dog. My dogs’ name is Harper and she is a Staffy x Labrador.<br> I enjoy playing video games with my mates when I can and love a good beer! I used to want to own and run my bar (still do)<br> which is a gaming lounge where people could come and drink and game, play tournaments and watch E-sports events.</p>
<p>I started thinking about getting into IT as a career path, as I have always been interested in IT and good at it I thought this might be a good place to start. <br> I picked RMIT to do my studies since it offered a bachelor’s in Information technology, and I can do it online while I am working full time.</p>
<p>I am hoping to get out of this course just a fundamental understanding of IT in general and be able to decide what path I would like to go down. I’ll be able to learn all the basic understanding I need.</p>
<p>I hope with what I am learning I can find a job within the IT industry. <br>I would love to get a job within game development or coding, I think that would be very fun and interesting to join and grow a career out of.</p>
<h3>&#128188 Job Prospects &#128187</h3>
<p>I found this job seek for a <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56123237?type=standout#sol=73641d8dca18cb61811b83c0ecd011951eb51f13">Senior Games Programmer</a> for Wicked Witch Software. This I get to work for an Australian based gaming software company that worked on some of my favourite games like  Age Of Empires 2 which is cool because a lot of the big game developers are international.<br> Working as a senior game programmer will allow me to advance my career in game development and gain more understanding of what it takes to not only make games but to run a businesses</p>
<p>The position requires at least 5 years of game programming in C++ and C# and communication skills, I don’t have the skill for the programming (C++ and C#) side as I haven’t studied or learnt anything about that kind of programming, but I feel like my previous jobs have given me excellent communication skills.</p>
<p>My plan for me to succeed in getting this job will have me looking into courses and lower-tier jobs to be able to get my skills as a programmer, while working for another position I can start getting my job experience in the industry and knowledge of programming. </p>
<h3>&#129346 Test's about Me &#129322</h3>
<h4>Myers-Brigs Test</h4>
<img src="photos\Myers-Brugs.png" alt="my Personality results" height="430" width="806" align="left"> <p>The results of the Myers Brigs test confirm to me what I believe in myself, I do feel like I am an extroverted person that use my feelings to drive my decisions in life. I think it pinpointed me and I would agree with these results. I think my results within teamwork allow me to be able to talk my mind when in a team environment and allow my teammates and coworkers to know what I think and feel, be able to express what I think is important to allow me and my teammates the best outcome with my work. Knowing everyone’s strengths and weaknesses when forming a team is great so you can play to everyone’s strengths and know what they will excel in, when forming a team I <br>would like to see people being interactive and understanding someone might not <br> know how to do something and need help.</p>
