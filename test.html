<h4>Myers-Brigs Test</h4>
<img src="Photos\Myers-Brugs.png" alt="my Personality results" height="350" width="750"> <p>The results of the Myers Brigs test confirm to me what I believe in myself, I do feel like I am an extroverted person that use my feelings to drive my decisions in life. I think it pinpointed me and I would agree with these results. I think my results within teamwork allow me to be able to talk my mind when in a team environment and allow my teammates and coworkers to know what I think and feel, be able to express what I think is important to allow me and my teammates the best outcome with my work. Knowing everyone’s strengths and weaknesses when forming a team is great so you can play to everyone’s strengths and know what they will excel in, when forming a team I <br>would like to see people being interactive and understanding someone might not <br> know how to do something and need help.</p>



<h4>Education planner Learning Style Quiz </h4>
<img src="Photos\Education planner Learning Style Quiz.png" alt="Education planner Learning Style Quiz"> <p>These results don’t seem to accurate I always thought I was more of a visual learner of things and doing more then sitting down a listening to someone talk about them. I feel like I learn more when someone shows and explains how to do something for me when working on a team and I need help than just someone telling me without showing.  This can affect my teamwork because I rely on people willing to show me how to do things, when I form a team I should remember that I am more of a visual and doing learner and my teammates should understand that I learn better in a visual and experience environment.</p>



<h4>Creativity Test</h4>
<img src="Photos\Creativity Test.png" alt="Creativity Test">
<p>I have always known that my creativity hasn’t been one of my strong suits, ever since school I have lost my creative side, I do like thinking creatively every now and then. Having a creative team is a bonus, people bring all their ideas to either make an idea or explore different ideas is useful, when forming a team you should always make sure you have some people that have a creative side so you can overcome most problems.</p>
