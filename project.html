  <h2 align=center>MIEP: A Medical Information Exchange Programme</h2>
  <p align=center>The MITBS is an application/website for law firms and insurance (customers) providers to use to retrieve patients’ and clients’ medical records quickly, easily and without going through a 3rd party to gain access to the medical records for their clients. With the providers (hospitals and clinics) able to easily access what requests are coming in and to be able to organise and inform the customers what is needed of them. Having direct communication with both parties will enable easier access to medical information, time management and manpower. If this product is successful, it will help people receive their claims/lawsuits quicker and easier.</p>
  <p align=center>I can see there being a big demand in this field as I am currently working for a company that Is trying to fulfil this demand and I theorise that they are lacking in the development of ease of use for both customers and providers. At the moment there is a lot of disconnection from both end parties, either one doesn’t know what is going on or the 3rd parties (the company I work for), If there was a system application or website where the providers and customer can take control it would make the work a whole lot easier for everyone.</p>
  <p align=center>MITBS service for the customers and providers interface will have both a web design and an app that can be run on any operating system. For the customers they will have a portal to be able to lodge requests through, for example, being for a medical negligence case against a Dr at a hospital, The customer needs the medical records of the client/patient, When the send of a request the providers (hospital or Clinic) protocols of what they need to validate the request (i.e.- Signed authority, Higher fee etc.) will pop up and the customer will be able to accept, download and/or Uploaded the required documents for this request. Once that is done the provider will get a notification either via the desktop application or via email where they can access the request and view all the related documents to be able to proceed with the request.</p>
  <p align=center>The customer will also be able to see a list of contacts at the provider’s end, for finance or admin for them to help out. The providers can update their information and let the customer know when the days they are working and the average turnaround days with a quick simple note of what they would like. </p>
  <p align=center>The customer can input rules that the provider has to follow it could be a certain authority that is needed to be able to complete the request, This will allow the customer to maintain their current request within their organisation and allow to maintain and delegate the request for their staff to attend too. </p>
  <p align=center>Once the request has been sent out and the hospital has confirmed that they have received the request and page will be generated for the request (case). On this page it will have a case ID, relevant information (name of the patient, DOB, type of request being a medical file copy or a medical report etc). On this page, both parties will be able to see case notes from one another and be able to interact by requesting a new authority or approval of a higher fee. The customer and provider can also contact one another by looking at details to contact. Also on this page, you will be able to pause a request if further information is required that can’t be given almost instantly.</p>
  <p align=center>Lastly, when the provider has got all the records and reports for the customer, they can upload it directly to the platform for the customer to download and will come under a complete section. If the customer is missing information for this request, they can go back to the provider to request further information. </p>
  <p align=center>This system will dynamically adapt to what the customer and provider need and requests. If the system can tell that there is a multiple of the same request, then it will alert the customer requesting the information. If a provider has a dedicated fee for its report writing or a dedicated independent Dr to write reports, it will let the customer know. </p>
  <p align=center>To manage this application, I think it will take a team of developers in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to enable this application and website to work. As well as cloud storage to hold lard sections of data. There will also have to be a legal team working for this company that creates the app as there is privacy data being handled with the software. Creating an AI that can handle understanding the needs of both parties will be a difficult challenge, I have looked only and there are a few Dynamic Case Management systems one being PEGA1 that could hand the case management system.</p>
  <p align=center>The team required wouldn’t be too hard to find to be able to complete this application, everyone will need to have a base understanding of Java, HTML, AI and CSS. We would also need small funding to kick this application/website off the ground for servers to be able to run the website and host the storage or able to buy cloud storage. I think if I personally was to be able to build this application I will need to study more into programming and AI learning. By myself, I could create a dummy website to be able to show investors and other keen programmers wanting to make their own company and project like this one.</p>
  <p align=center>If this project was to be successful it will help the world of medical information exchange from providers and customer. With the ease of access to the 2 parties, the client will be able to get their outcome of claim or lawsuit quicker. With the development of MIEP, I would be out of a job but would be moved into a new job of developing code and maintaining an infrastructure of an application that will be helping people for the greater good. My experience within this industry has shown that there is a lot of going back and forth and a lot of people using different systems to get the same outcome. </p>
  <p align=center>I hope that one day this will come to reality to give the outcomes to help the world </p>
